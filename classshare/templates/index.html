<h2>What is ClassShare?</h2>
<p>ClassShare is a website for I Schoolers to share information about interesting, I School-ish classes in other departments at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley is a big place, with so many interesting things going on. The I School is an interdisciplinary program, with students with a wide variety of interests, which benefits from exposure to other departments on campus. However, we've found that it's hard to hear about classes in other departments, especially before the semester gets going. When we have managed to hear about and take external classes, it was usually through the in-person recommendations of alumni and second-year students. ClassShare is a venue to formalize those knowledge transfers and make them accessible to all I Schoolers through course postings and reviews.</p>
